# OnlyArt Foundation Whitepaper

### _“Your Art, Our Passion”_

We are standing behind an ambitious mission. The objective of OnlyArt Foundation encompasses many areas such as the most important collection of inspiring digital artist of the 21st century, but at its core, the idea began as a way to connect artist and collectors like never before. In particular, digital artists now have a larger and more powerful platform to convey their artistry to an entirely new legion of admirers. Both artists and collectors understand that more exposure yields better returns on investments and access to a larger audience. In the future, it is anticipated that all types of artists will be able to utilize decentralized cryptocurrency for art and that is where OnlyArt’s expertise comes in – bringing these concepts to the mainstream and implementing the necessary steps to ensure its success.

### The impact of NFTs in the art industry can no longer be denied.

Time Magazine has already considered how NFTs or “non-fungible tokens” have dramatically impacted the art world, and various predictions on how it could potentially evolve and expand. In the past few years, this is an exciting time in the industry. OnlyArt Foundation is a platform that connects innovators and artists within the creative realm while also bringing about positive global change. What has already been proven is that there is a growing market for acquiring art in new ways, with virtual engagement one of the largest growing sectors in the art world today.

### The art world is rapidly evolving, and we must be ahead of the curve.

No matter what industry you may be in, the world around us is changing at the blink of an eye, and through this initiative, we can work together to ensure that positive change is achieved through our efforts. OnlyArt Foundation functions as a channel that balances the margins so that every individual becomes a vital component to progress. OnlyArt Foundation takes the latest artistic achievements to produce an open and inclusive digital community that is committed and supportive of the creative realm.

### Let us introduce the OnlyArt Token.

OnlyArt token is the world’s first algorithmic cryptocurrency being partially backed by digital collateral and partially stabilized art syndication. OnlyArt Foundation was established to empower and educate individuals with an interest in art. Our mission is to have our OnlyArt token provide access to art ownership without keeping tangible assets. The foundation showcases and awards top artists globally.

The smart contract protocol was launched in 2021 on the Ethereum platform (ERC-20). The initial concept and blueprint took several years to come to fruition

OnlyArt token is a decentralized, dividend-generating smart contract that rewards OnlyArt token’s wallet holders via an Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP). The smart contract uses a static reward system; 1% of every transaction is split into two modules. First, .5% is distributed to OnlyArt wallet holders, while the other .5% is permanently burned.

On the centennial anniversary of the OnlyArt Token, January 1st, 2121, the .5% reward and .5% burned will no longer take place. The founding team of OnlyArt vision has always been on the long-term focus and reward. With that in mind, we feel enough tokens will be burned by 2121 that will make the OnlyArt token scarce and more valuable for our current and next generation.

### Automatic Liquidity Pool

OnlyArt uses an automatic liquidity pool algorithm (AutoLP) in its token contract. The smart blockchain contact algorithm collects .5% from each transaction, whether the order is a buy or sell and adds it to the liquidity pool.

Let’s start off with what a liquidity pool (LP) is. A liquidity pool is a collection of funds, or in this case OnlyArt tokens, locked in a smart contract. Liquidity Pools are used to facilitate decentralized (DeFi) trading. For example, every time an OnlyArt token is sold, .5% of the OnlyArt token is redistributed among the holders in a static reward system that is claimed quarterly.

### Static Reward System

All of the tokens generated from the .5% transaction go to OnlyArt token holders. The percentage of rewards the OnlyArt Token wallet earns is calculated by the percentage of OnlyArt tokens in the wallet that the holder owns among other wallet holders.

### Security

We know security is important, several audits will be implemented and updated to the whitepaper.
